# Refactoring Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup ✅
**Completed on**: [Current Date]

**Achievements**:
- Created basic directory structure
  ```
  src/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── formatters.py
  ├── parsers.py
  ├── utils.py
  ├── constants.py
  └── main.py
  ```
- Set up test directory structure
  ```
  tests/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── test_formatters.py
  ├── test_parsers.py
  ├── test_utils.py
  └── test_main.py
  ```
- Created requirements.txt with core dependencies
- Added basic imports and placeholder comments in all files
- Created initial test structure with basic test case
- Original hunter.py remains functional and untouched

**Validation**:
- ✅ Directory structure verified
- ✅ All files created with proper imports
- ✅ Basic test runs successfully
- ✅ Original functionality preserved

### Phase 2: Extract Constants ✅
**Completed on**: [Current Date]

**Achievements**:
- Created `src/constants.py` with organized constants
- Extracted all hardcoded values from `hunter.py`:
  - Regular expression patterns
  - Language detection hints
  - Language mappings
  - Code block detection patterns
  - Content type enums
  - Formatting constants
  - HTML content extraction settings
  - API configuration
  - System messages

**Validation**:
- ✅ All constants identified and extracted
- ✅ Constants organized by category
- ✅ Type hints added for better maintainability
- ✅ Documentation added for each constant group

### Phase 3: Formatter Refactoring ✅
**Completed on**: [Current Date]

**Achievements**:
- Created modular formatter class hierarchy:
  - `BaseFormatter`: Common text cleaning utilities
  - `CodeFormatter`: Code-specific formatting
  - `LinkFormatter`: Link and image formatting
- Consolidated related functions:
  - Combined `clean_text` and `clean_code` into unified `clean_content`
  - Merged code block detection and formatting
  - Unified link and image formatting
- Removed duplicated constants by using centralized `constants.py`
- Added comprehensive test suite in `test_formatters.py`
- Added proper type hints and documentation

**Validation**:
- ✅ All formatter tests passing
- ✅ Code duplication eliminated
- ✅ Constants properly centralized
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Type hints added

### Phase 4: Parser Refactoring ✅
**Completed on**: [Current Date]

**Achievements**:
- Created modular parsing system with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented parser classes for different content types:
  - `HeadingParser`: Handles h1-h6 elements
  - `CodeBlockParser`: Handles code blocks with language detection
  - `ListParser`: Handles ordered and unordered lists with nesting
  - `LinkParser`: Handles links and images
  - `ParagraphParser`: Handles paragraph content
- Implemented parser factory pattern for dynamic parser selection
- Moved parsing logic from main extract_content to specialized classes
- Added comprehensive test suite in `test_parsers.py`
- Integrated with existing `formatters.py` and `constants.py`
- Added proper type hints and documentation

**Validation**:
- ✅ All parser tests passing
- ✅ Code duplication eliminated
- ✅ Parser factory pattern implemented
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Type hints added
- ✅ Integration with formatters and constants verified

### Phase 5: Utils Refactoring ⏳
- Status: Ready to start
- Dependencies: Phase 2 ✅, Phase 4 ✅

### Phase 6: Main Script Cleanup ⏳
- Status: Not started
- Dependencies: Phases 3, 4, and 5

### Phase 7: Documentation and Optimization ⏳
- Status: Not started
- Dependencies: All previous phases

## Notes
- Project initialized with clean structure
- All files prepared for their respective implementation phases
- Test infrastructure ready for expansion
- Constants extracted and organized
- Formatter refactoring completed with improved maintainability
- Ready to begin parser refactoring
