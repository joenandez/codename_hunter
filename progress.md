# Refactoring Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup ✅
**Completed on**: [Current Date]

**Achievements**:
- Created basic directory structure
  ```
  src/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── formatters.py
  ├── parsers.py
  ├── utils.py
  ├── constants.py
  └── main.py
  ```
- Set up test directory structure
  ```
  tests/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── test_formatters.py
  ├── test_parsers.py
  ├── test_utils.py
  └── test_main.py
  ```
- Created requirements.txt with core dependencies
- Added basic imports and placeholder comments in all files
- Created initial test structure with basic test case
- Original hunter.py remains functional and untouched

**Validation**:
- ✅ Directory structure verified
- ✅ All files created with proper imports
- ✅ Basic test runs successfully
- ✅ Original functionality preserved

### Phase 2: Extract Constants ✅
**Completed on**: [Current Date]

**Achievements**:
- Created `src/constants.py` with organized constants
- Extracted all hardcoded values from `hunter.py`:
  - Regular expression patterns
  - Language detection hints
  - Language mappings
  - Code block detection patterns
  - Content type enums
  - Formatting constants
  - HTML content extraction settings
